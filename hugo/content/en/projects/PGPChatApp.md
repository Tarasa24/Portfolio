## General info

[React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/) app for Android (with some configuration cross-platform also possible), combining privacy of [PGP encryption standard](https://www.openpgp.org/) with all the fundemental features of an chatapp. Supports texting, sending media, notifications and even [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) calling, all encrypted and signed with your own keypair, contents of your messages including files are therefore by design completely obscure to the relaying server. It even has dark mode!

## Setup

Download and install [latest release](https://github.com/Tarasa24/PGPChatApp/releases/tag/1.1.0). Inside the app then either generate new keypair or use existing private key that has been previously exported.
